NAME
    JSON::XS::VersionOneAndTwo - Support versions 1 and 2 of JSON::XS

SYNOPSIS
      use JSON::XS::VersionOneAndTwo;
      my $data = { 'three' => [ 1, 2, 3 ] };

      # use JSON::XS version 1.X style
      my $json1 = to_json($data);
      my $data1 = from_json($json1);
  
      # or use JSON::XS version 2.X style
      my $json2 = encode_json($data);
      my $data2 = decode_json($json2);

DESCRIPTION
    JSON::XS is by far the best JSON module on the CPAN. However, it changed
    its API at version 2.01. If you have to maintain code which may be run
    on systems with either version one or two then this is a bit of a pain.
    This module takes the pain away without sacrificing performance.
